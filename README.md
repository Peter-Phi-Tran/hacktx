Tachyon - AI-Powered Financial Constellation Platform
Tachyon is an AI-powered financial advisor for Toyota vehicle financing. It guides users through a multi-turn conversational interview and visualizes personalized financing and leasing options as an interactive 3D "financial constellation".

âœ¨ Features
AI-Powered Interview: Conducts a conversational interview to gather detailed user data on financial status, vehicle needs, and lifestyle preferences.

Multi-Agent Orchestration: Uses a Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) root agent to coordinate three specialized sub-agents (Interviewer, Reviewer, Node Maker) to ensure a complete profile and generate accurate scenarios.

3D Financial Constellation: Visualizes 5 initial, personalized financing/leasing scenarios using a 3D physics-based engine (React-Three-Fiber).

Scenario Deep-Dive: Allows users to "expand" a scenario node, triggering the Node Maker agent to generate up to 10 levels of branching options (e.g., different payment structures, trim levels, add-ons, or alternative vehicles).

Secure Authentication: Integrates Google OAuth for user sign-in and session management.
